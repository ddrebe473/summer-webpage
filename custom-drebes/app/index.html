    <p>In the beginning of July I went up north to williams, Arizona for ccv camp(church camp). I spent 3 days here inside big cabins. It was nice but pool was closed to due to no life guard but everything else was open. The was amazing there but i missed both breakfasts and only made it to the other meals. I met new people and saw old friends there.</p></div>
    <div><div id="circus" class="morbd"></div>
    <p>During June I went to Circus Circus with 4 other friends and stayed there for 3 days. We expolored the Vegas strip and I hated that part, long walking, too many people, everything expensive. I bought a bag of M&Ms for 24$. I still ate though. The rides in circus circus were fun. I got sick on 1 ride, which was the T-cup ride. The car ride to Vegas and back was cramped. Overall it was fun.</p>

    <p>The last week of July I went to VIP airsoft, I went with my brother. I brought my own airsoft gun but it fired to fast so i had to rent one of theirs. I still had fun. The last game I had the spring switched out with another which made it fire 70MPH slower. Me and my brother still had fun.</p>
